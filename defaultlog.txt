Front Porch:
The wood creaks under your feet.  A welcome sign is nailed onto the front door.  Down the stairs is a path.
Exits: north

Living Room:
Curtains hang over the window, making it a bit difficult to see.  The fireplace is unlit, but the warm weather outside makes it feel temperate.  Out the door to the south is the front porch.  To the north is the downstairs hall.
