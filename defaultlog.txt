
You flip to the next page of your book. Your eyes skim the page, unfocused, and the chair creaks as you rock back and forth.

It’s been a while since you've felt this bored.

Your master has gone off into town without you for once, and you have been left alone in your little cottage in the woods. Relocating yourself to the front porch has done little to alleviate the mind-numbing-ness of The Uses of Wratagrass, but there was quite literally nothing else to do, barred from making potions as you were. You decide to take a break and close the book with a thwump. Your neck is a bit stiff from looking down for so long, which you pout about. 

'I’m only ten,' you grumble.

The green of the forest is a welcome sight, and you're tempted to go for a walk against your master’s wishes until you see a clear shimmering wall reflected in the light. Indignation rises up inside of you. 

A barrier. Most likely to warn Master if you leave, as if the babysitter wasn’t enough. Even now, you can feel the invisible eyes of Master’s cat watching your every move. 

'I’m already ten!' you say.

Then, as if purposefully trying to worsen your mood, your own cat appears along the edge of the forest, past the barrier, somewhere he definitely wasn’t supposed to be.

You jump up. 'What are you doing? If you get spirited away or something, I’m the one who’s going to get into trouble!' 

 He stares at you for a moment before turning with utmost indifference toward the forest.

 'Stop!' You scramble toward him, but by the time you reach the beginnings of the barrier, he’s disappeared into the trees.

Front Porch:
The porch is small, only about half the length of the actual house, and the worn wood creaks beneath your feet.  There are no furnishings besides an inelegant wooden chair.  Behind it, a window peers into the living room, but green curtains block the view.  A sign hangs on the door.
Exits: north down 

> go north
Living Room:
The lighting is dim, the curtains over the window making it difficult to see.  Since it’s the warm season, the fireplace is unlit.  Before it, two chairs sit on either side of a low table.  This is where Master does business with her customers and relaxes when she is off hours, but you rarely spend your time here.  It feels stuffy to you.
Exits: south north 

> go north
Downstairs Hall:
There’s a painting on the wall to your left.  It looks like one that you made with your fingers when you were younger, and it’s been there for as long as you can remember.  You think Master called it abstract.
Exits: east south up 

> go up
Second Floor Landing:
A small cabinet sits on the landing, and another painting hangs above it.  This one depicts the founder of the nearby town.  She wears her iconic armor and stands proudly, sword in hand.
Exits: east south down 

> go east
Your Bedroom:
Your bed is still unmade, something you should fix before Master gets back.  On your desk is a mess of pins and pens, all of which you found on your last trip to town.  People should be more careful with their belongings, you feel.

Upstairs Hall:
While one side of the hall is lined by a railing, the other is decorated with pressed leaves.  They are carefully arranged in their frames, and the orange, greens, and browns add some much needed color to the house.  In the midst of the leaves, there is a closed door leading to the bathroom. 
Exits: south north

Master's Bedroom:
It’s been months since you last stepped foot in here, but you find that nothing has changed.  The room reflects Master’s personality.  The bed, desk, and armoire are all the same shade of brown, and you bet that there is not even a molecule of air out of place.

Kitchen:

Backyard:
The yard is covered in all sorts of plants from succulents to trees.  Most are mature and blooming, and you love the vibrant colors, even if the gardening is a lot of work.  There are rows for walking, so you don’t accidently step on any of the low-growing plants.  Next to the ash mountain tree, a hatch sits flush to the ground.

detection barrier

More runes can be added to greaten the strength of the barrier.  While the stabilizer cannot be hidden lest the magic not take hold, this author suggests making the others indiscernible.  A word of warning: if you choose to take my advice, do not keep the child runes far from the parent.

Fairsway Weapons:
‘Open!’ the sign on the glass door cheerily exclaims.  Display cases show off the variety of weapons for sale.  A lone broadsword hangs on the wall to your right, and there’s a crack in the floor beneath it.  Tave, the owner, stands behind the counter and greets you when you walk in.  As usual, his face is set in a scowl.

South Market:
People from all around the country gather in Fairsway to peruse the newest innovations in magic.  No matter how many times you come into town, you still can’t get used to the crowds.  Businesses of all types line the streets, the bright storefronts designed to draw the eye.  You keep getting knocked around, and you hope one of the less popular stores can give you some refuge.

Town Square:
A large fountain marks the center of the Merchant District.  You see Syl next to it, packing some boxes into the back of his cart.  Every time he bends over, his long hair falls in his face.

Gravel crunching beneath your feet, you step onto a trodden down path.  The trees in this forest are known for their height, and you feel even smaller than usual.

Fairy Herbs:
A field of orreamin is spread out before you, and the plants glow with fairy magic.  You watch as the fairies themselves chatter with one another, flying to and fro.  They must know that you’re here, but thankfully, they seem to be ignoring you for the most part.  The only one acknowledging your presence is side-eying you.

Exits: south up

Front Porch:
The porch is small, only about half the length of the actual house, and the worn wood creaks beneath your feet.  There are no furnishings besides an inelegant wooden chair.  Behind it, a window peers into the living room, but green curtains block the view.  A sign hangs on the door.
Exits: north down 

> go north
Living Room:
The lighting is dim, the curtains over the window making it difficult to see.  Since it’s the warm season, the fireplace is unlit.  Before it, two chairs sit on either side of a low table.  This is where Master does business with her customers and relaxes when she is off hours, but you rarely spend your time here.  It feels stuffy to you.
Exits: south north 

> go north
Downstairs Hall:
There’s a painting on the wall to your left.  It looks like one that you made with your fingers when you were younger, and it’s been there for as long as you can remember.  You think Master called it abstract.
Exits: east south up 

> go east
Kitchen:
Compared to the orderliness of the rest of the house, the kitchen is quite messy.  Dirty pots and pans clutter the counter space, still not washed and put away since breakfast.  Master did leave in a hurry.  It must have pained her to leave any part of her house in this state.
Items: head of garlic   
Exits: north west

Back Porch:
This is where you usually do your studies.  Your comfy chair is nestled in the corner, a table to sit a drink on next to it.  There is a nice view of the backyard, and you can smell the flowers from the garden.
Exits: south down 

> go down
Backyard:
The yard is covered in all sorts of plants from succulents to trees.  Most are mature and blooming, and you love the vibrant colors, even if the gardening is a lot of work.  There are rows for walking, so you don’t accidently step on any of the low-growing plants.  Next to the ash mountain tree, a hatch sits flush to the ground.

Over twenty cauldrons sit atop the tables lining the walls.  Master has left several potions brewing, and one has overflowed, coating the floor in a gray mist.  Above your head, sun blossom bulbs shine with bright light.

Forest Guardian:
There is a creature draped across a wooden throne.  He looks human, but you know he is not.  You’ve met him once before when Master dragged you along to pay respects.  He seems to be looking at something above your head, and you wonder if he knows you’re here.  The forest guardian smiles.

After dealing with the crowds for so long, this place is almost eerily silent.  There is no line before the main desk, and a woman sits behind it, resting her head on her cheek and looking bored.  Her nametag says that she’s Official Camret.
